<h1>Annotated RAADS-R</h1>

<p>The RAADS-R test is a self-test designed to assess autism, but the way it is written ironically tends to be quite confusing and frustrating for autistic people.

<p>This is a version of the test annotated by an autistic woman, to make the questions less confusing and more straightforward to answer accurately, with added context and examples as necessary. Autistic women in particular often are quite high masking, and (as they are adults) typically have developed extensive coping mechanisms without realizing it, which in the original version of the test might lead them to answer questions inaccurately. Part of this is also due, again ironically, to the autistic tendency to take things too literally and view questions in black-and-white.

<p><strong>This is not a clinical diagnostic tool.</strong> No guarantee is made as to the accuracy of the results of this test. This annotated version of the test has not been subject to any kind of peer review, and was not annotated by somebody with credentials in psychology. 

<p>To clearly differentiate from the original test wording, <span class="ctx">annotations providing clarification and context are rendered like this</span>.

<h3 class="ctx">General Notes</h3>
<p class="ctx">All these questions are written from the perspective of an allistic (non-autistic) person. That is to say, any question asking you how you relate to other people is asking you how you relate to <i>people who are not autistic</i>, and any question asking if something is true about you is asking if someone who is not autistic would think that was true about you.

<p class="ctx">Answers saying something is true aren't saying something is <i>always true</i>, they're saying something is true most of the time. Likewise, "never true" doesn't mean the thing is literally never true, it just means it <i>usually</i> isn't true. Don't get tripped up on the literal definitions of "always" and "never."

<p class="ctx">The "true when I was younger than 16" is really getting at "true before I explicitly learned how to deal with it." The age 16 is a stand-in for adolescence in general, which it so say, it's a stand in for the coming of age process of learning how to function as an adult in an allistic society.

<p>Scores are interpeted from data in <a target="blank_" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3134766/">Ritvo et al's paper which introduced RAADS-R</a>.

<p>65 is the cutoff indicating autism (no allistic individuals scored higher, and only 3% of autistic individuals scored lower).

<p>No autistic individuals scored below 52.

<p>133 is the average score for autistic individuals in the study.
